Let me share my way of practicing problems...

- Pick a problem, don't see topic tags yet. **Give 40 min**s at least to the problem. Two things might happen after 40 mins, either you have got an idea of how to solve this problem or you have no clue what to do with the problem.
    
- If you have an idea of how to solv  e the problem, go ahead and try to implement it. Try to get either **TLE or WA or AC**. If you have no idea how to solve the problem then open the question tags, think in that direction, and give some 20-30 mins.
    
- After all of this struggle, either you have solved the problem or you are still clueless. Now the real learning begins, even if you have solved the problem follow the steps listed below,
    
    - Open the discuss tab, and sort the posts by the number of votes. You will find some posts which contain only code and some posts with an explanation of the solution approach also.
    - Read the post with the explanation of the solution approach, have a pen and paper alongside you. Draw test cases and try to understand the approach. Make your test cases and see whether this approach is working or not.
    - Now you have a clear idea of the solution approach, try to implement it on your own. Don't copy the code from anywhere, you have to write your working code, it is crucial to write your code.
    - Once you have got your solution accepted by this approach also look for different approaches in the discussion tab and do the same.
- The Job isn't over yet, in some problems you will find a **solution tab** which is locked in some problems or unlocked in some problems. If the solution tab is unlocked then read the whole article, it's a **gold mine** just like the discussion tab.
