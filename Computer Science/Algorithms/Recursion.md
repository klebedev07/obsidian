A recursive function should have the following properties sp that it does not result in infinite loop
- A simple base case - a termirnating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
-  A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all othe cases towards the base case


Recurence relation - the relationship between the result pf a problem and the result of its subproblems.
